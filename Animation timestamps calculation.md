## Animation timestamps calculation
###  Animation timestamps calculation
1.  we need to take slide transition time based on each slide
    
2.  formula: select empty cell then after that we have to select the cell (which we want - with ) and then click on - then select the cell (which we want - from ) at last we have to click enter then we will get correct answer after deducting the time
    
3.  calculation for first slide transition is ( second slide - first slide)
    
4.  transition for second slide is (third slide - second slide ) and so on
    
5.  for the last slide transition time will be (ending time of audio - previous slide transition time)
    
6.  calculation for animation of text, (text appears time - slide transition time)
